# BehavioralSimulator & Assembler
This project is part of Computer Architecture Project, which consists of three main components:
1. Assembler – Converts assembly language programs into machine code.
2. Behavioral Simulator – Simulates the execution of machine code instructions.
3. Assembly Programs – Example programs written in assembly language.

## Components
### 1. Assembler
- Translates assembly instructions into machine code.
- Supports basic arithmetic, memory access, and branching instructions.
- Outputs binary code for execution in the Behavioral Simulator.

### 2. Behavioral Simulator
- Simulates the execution of machine code.
- Supports instructions such as lw, add, beq, and halt.

### 3. Assembly Programs
- Multiplication Program
- Combination (n, r) Program
- Fibonacci Program
